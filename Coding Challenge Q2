```{python}
# Read in libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import plotly.express as px
```

```{python}
# Read in the names data
url = "https://github.com/byuidatascience/data4names/raw/master/data-raw/names_year/names_year.csv"
names = pd.read_csv(url)
```

## Question #2:

### [Fix the series to all be `np.nan` and calculate the standard deviation (2 decimal places):]

```{python}
# Question # Code
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Original series
problem = pd.Series(['N/A', 15, 22, 45, 31, -999, 21, 2, 0, 0, 0, 'broken'])

# Replace invalid values with np.nan
problem_cleaned = pd.to_numeric(problem, errors='coerce')  # Convert to numeric, invalid values become NaN
problem_cleaned.replace(-999, np.nan, inplace=True)  # Replace -999 with NaN

# Calculate standard deviation (ignoring NaN values)
std_dev = round(problem_cleaned.std(), 2)

print(f"Cleaned Series:\n{problem_cleaned}")
print(f"Standard Deviation: {std_dev}")


```

When done with a question, render it to a `.html` file and upload it for the question. Either re-downolad this template or file -> save as -> a new file name and then replace the text in the question with the new question text.
